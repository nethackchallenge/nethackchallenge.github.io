## Why

NetHack is one of the oldest and arguably most impactful videogames in history,
as well as being one of the hardest roguelikes currently being played by humans.
It is procedurally generated, rich in entities and dynamics, and overall an
extremely challenging environment for current state-of-the-art RL agents, while
being much cheaper to run compared to other challenging testbeds. Through NLE,
we wish to establish NetHack as one of the next challenges for research in
decision making and machine learning.


## What is NetHack Learning Environment?

The NetHack Learning Environment (NLE) is a Reinforcement Learning environment presented at [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020).
NLE is based on [NetHack 3.6.6](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/tree/NetHack-3.6.6_PostRelease) and designed to provide a standard RL interface to the game, and comes with tasks that function as a first step to evaluate agents on this new environment.

You can read more about NLE in the [NeurIPS 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13760), and about NetHack in its [original
README](./README.nh), at [nethack.org](https://nethack.org/), and on the
[NetHack wiki](https://nethackwiki.com).
