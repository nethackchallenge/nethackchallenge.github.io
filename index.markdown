## Welcome to NetHack 2021 NeurIPS Challenge

The NetHack Challenge is based on the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), where teams will compete to build the best agents to play the game of NetHack.  

### Why?

NetHack is a ASCII-rendered single-player dungeon crawl game that is one of the oldest and most difficult computer games in history.  NetHack is procedurally-generated, with hundreds of different entities and complex environment dynamics, presenting an extremely challenging environment for both current state-of-the-art RL agents and humans, while crucially being lightning-fast to simulate. 

We are excited that this competition offers machine learning students, researchers and NetHack-bot builders the opportunity to participate in a grand challenge in AI without prohibitive
computational costsâ€”and we are eagerly looking forward to the wide variety of submissions.

Check out [NetHack Wiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page) and [nethack.org](http://nethack.org/) to learn more about NetHack.


### What is NetHack Learning Environment?

The NetHack Learning Environment (NLE) is a Reinforcement Learning environment presented at [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020).
NLE is based on [NetHack 3.6.6](https://github.com/NetHack/NetHack/tree/NetHack-3.6.6_PostRelease) and designed to provide a standard RL interface to the game, and comes with tasks that function as a first step to evaluate agents on this new environment.
You can read more about NLE in the [NeurIPS 2020 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.13760).
